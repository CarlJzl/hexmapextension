<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a name="intro" />
<p>This is an extension for creating hex map in
<a href="http://www.inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>.
It can also be used to make brick patterns of staggered rectangles.
</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>
<a name="install" />
<p>To install the extension you need to copy <em>hexmap.inx</em>
and <em>hexmap.py</em>
into the <em>extensions</em> folder (directory) of your
Inkscape installation. In Linux this will typically be
<em>/usr/share/inkscape/extensions</em>,
or <em>~/.config/inkscape/extensions</em>.
In Windows it will be something like
<em>C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions</em>. After (re)starting
Inkscape you should now have <em>Boardgames</em> submenu in the
Extensions menu, and in that an entry for running
<em>Generate Hex Map</em>.
</p>

<h2>Running The Extension</h2>
<a name="effects" />
<p>Creates a grid of hexagons over the document. Five layers
are created:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Hex Grid</dt><dd>The hexgrid itself. Each hex border is an
separate line object.</dd>
<dt>Hex Centerdot</dt><dd>A small circle in the center of each
hex, as is needed for many games.</dd>
<dt>Hex Fill</dt><dd>One polygon object for each hex. Can be used to
quickly add a color or pattern to hexes.</dd>
<dt>Hex Coordinates</dt><dd>The coordinate label of each hex. The
format of each label is controlled by parameters in the effect's dialog
window.</dd>
<dt>Hex Corners</dt><dd>Corners/Vertices
 of each hex only. Use as alternative to
the normal hexgrid if you prefer a map with less visible grid.
Some people call these caltrops.</dd>
